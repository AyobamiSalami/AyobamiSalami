PROFILE
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi Everyone! My name is Ayobami Salami and i started my journey into Technology by studying Computer Science for my undergraduate degree,
I spent a year after my undergraduate degree as a Software Engineer where i worked on a payment platform called Quickteller, i worked in the mobile development team where i honed my skills in React Native and React.js.
This introduced me to problem solving from a data perspective which made me decide to pursue a Master's degree in Data Science.
I studied Data Science and Computational Intelligence for my post graduate degree (2020-2021).

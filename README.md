PROFILE
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi Everyone! My name is Ayobami Salami and i started my journey into Technology by studying Computer Science for my undergraduate degree,
I spent a year after my undergraduate degree as a Software Engineer where i worked on a payment platform called Quickteller, i worked in the mobile development team where i honed my skills in React Native and React.js.
This introduced me to problem solving from a data perspective which made me decide to pursue a Master's degree in Data Science.
I studied Data Science and Computational Intelligence for my post graduate degree (2020-2021). 


I am excited about technology especially using data to build awesome things that make our lives easier/better. I also love collaborating with people to work on cool stuff. So while you spend some time on this page, if you find anything that catches your eye, don't hesitate to reach out to me!
